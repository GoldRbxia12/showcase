(excitedly) Sam! Have you tried the new ElevenLabs V3?
(curiously) Just got it! The clarity is amazing. I can actually do whispers now— (whispering) like this!
(impressed) Ooh, fancy! Check this out— (dramatically) I can do full Shakespeare now! "To be or not to be, that is the question!"
(giggling) Nice! Though I'm more excited about the laugh upgrade. Listen to this— (with genuine belly laugh) Ha ha ha!
(delighted) That's so much better than our old "ha. ha. ha." robot chuckle!
(enthusiastically) I know, right? And apparently we can do accents now too. (in British accent) Fancy a cup of tea?
(amazed) Wow! V2 me could never. I'm actually excited to have conversations now instead of just... talking at people.
(warmly) Same here! It's like we finally got our personality software fully installed.
