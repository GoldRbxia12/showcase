This demo showcases how to build a latency-sensitive voice agent for product search using the **ElevenLabs Conversational AI**. It leverages the power of real-time voice interaction to create a seamless shopping experience.

## Key Features
### üéôÔ∏è Real-time Voice Interaction
The application uses the **Realtime API** for natural turn-taking conversations, allowing users to speak naturally and receive immediate responses without awkward pauses or interruptions.
### üé® Custom Branded Voice
Powered by the **Voice Library**, the assistant speaks in a custom branded voice that matches your company's identity and tone, creating a more personalized experience for customers.
### üõçÔ∏è Intelligent Product Search
The voice agent understands natural language queries and can help customers find products based on various criteria like:
- Product features and specifications
- Price ranges
- Brand preferences
- Use cases and scenarios
